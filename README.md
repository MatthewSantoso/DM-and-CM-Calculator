# DM-and-CM-Calculator
Macroporosity and Macrovoid Count Density Calculator

Authors: Matthew S. Santoso, Alexander T. Bridge, Alexander V. Hillsley, Joan F. Brennecke, and Benny D. Freeman

Requirements: 
- MATLAB R2021a
- Image Processing Toolbox
- Computer Vision Toolbox

Notes:
- Use TIF or TIFF images for best results, PNG is essentially only for testing idealized membrane cross sections.
- Macrovoid count density (CM) functionality is only tested with SEM images from an FEI Quanta 650 ESEM
